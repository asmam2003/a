I began college journey as a Political Science major, then transitioned to a STEM degree. Some of my past experiences
include tutoring students in cryptography and researching the addition of anti-spoofing measures to a telecommunication
protocol. Some of my skills include speak Arabic, intermediate Russian, curiosity, occasional problem-solving and a little bit of networking and Linux. For now, I want to gain pen testing skills related to networking and maybe malware analysis.
I want to be a well-rounded cybersecurity person in the future.
