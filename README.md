I began college journey as a Political Science major, the. transitioned to a STEM degree. My experiences
include tutoring students in cryptography, researching the addition of anti-spoofing measures to a telecommunication
protocol, and gathering open-source intelligence. I speak Arabic, intermediate Russian, curiosity, occasional problem-solving and a little bit of networking and Linux. For now, I want to gain pen testing skills related to networking and maybe malware analysis.
I want to be a well-rounded cybersecurity person in the future.
